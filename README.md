# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis and classification models, helping to identify fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets.

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in an imbalanced dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and classification algorithms. It helps in identifying fraud patterns effectively for practical learning and real-world applications.

## Features
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
✅ EDA and Visualization  
✅ Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE, undersampling)  
✅ Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)

## Dataset
- [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
